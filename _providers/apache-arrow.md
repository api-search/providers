description: Apache Arrow is a cross-language development platform for in-memory analytics developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It specifies a standardized, language-independent columnar memory format for flat and nested data, organized for efficient analytic operations on modern hardware including CPUs and GPUs. Arrow provides computational libraries in C++, Java, Python (PyArrow), R, Go, Rust, JavaScript, C#, Ruby, Julia, and Swift, along with zero-copy streaming messaging via IPC and a high-performance data transfer framework called Arrow Flight (built on gRPC).
