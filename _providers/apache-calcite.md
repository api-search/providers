description: Apache Calcite is a dynamic data management framework developed by the Apache Software Foundation that provides SQL parsing, query planning and optimization, and data federation capabilities. It serves as the SQL engine and query optimizer for many big data systems including Apache Hive, Druid, Flink, Kafka Streams, and others. Calcite provides a Java API for embedding SQL capabilities into applications, a JDBC adapter for connecting heterogeneous data sources, and an extensible relational algebra framework for building custom query optimizers.
