description: A collection of resources, APIs, and standards related to AI agent skills and capabilities. Agent skills represent the tools, functions, and capabilities that AI agents can invoke to accomplish tasks — spanning web search, code execution, file management, memory, and external API integrations. This topic covers the major platforms and frameworks that define how agent skills are declared, discovered, and invoked.
features:
- description: AI agents can invoke user-defined or platform-provided functions based on natural language instructions, with structured input/output schemas.
  name: Function Calling
- description: Platforms like Anthropic and OpenAI run certain agent skills (web search, code execution) on their own infrastructure, removing the need for client-side execution.
  name: Server-Side Tool Execution
- description: The Model Context Protocol provides a universal adapter layer enabling agents to discover and call any MCP-compatible server as a skill.
  name: MCP Integration
- description: Frameworks like Google ADK support coordinating multiple specialized agents, with skills delegated across agent boundaries via protocols like A2A.
  name: Multi-Agent Orchestration
- description: Agent skill definitions can enforce strict JSON Schema compliance to ensure agents produce well-formed tool calls matching the declared parameter schema.
  name: Strict Schema Enforcement
- description: Anthropic's tool_search server tool enables agents to discover available tools at runtime without statically declaring all tool schemas upfront.
