description: AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) is an open standard for message-oriented middleware governed by OASIS and standardized as ISO/IEC 19464. AMQP 1.0 enables interoperable, asynchronous communication between applications across different platforms and vendors. It defines a wire-level protocol supporting reliable queuing, flexible routing, publish/subscribe, and request/reply messaging patterns. Major implementations include Apache ActiveMQ/Artemis, RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus, Red Hat AMQ, and Apache Qpid.
