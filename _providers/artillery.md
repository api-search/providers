description: Artillery is an open source load testing and performance testing platform for APIs, microservices, and web applications. Built with Node.js and available as an npm package, Artillery supports HTTP/1, HTTP/2, WebSocket, Socket.IO, gRPC, and custom protocols through plugins. It includes a YAML-based test scenario definition language, a plugin ecosystem for extending functionality, and Artillery Cloud for distributed load testing, CI/CD integration, and centralized reporting. Artillery is used by developers, QA engineers, and SREs to run load tests, performance benchmarks, Playwright-based synthetic monitoring, and end-to-end tests at scale. The project is licensed under MPL-2.0 and maintained by Artilleryio.
