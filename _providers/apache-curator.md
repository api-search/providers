description: Apache Curator is a Java/JVM client library for Apache ZooKeeper, governed by the Apache Software Foundation, that provides a high-level API framework, fluent builders, and pre-built distributed coordination recipes including leader election, distributed locks, barriers, caches, counters, and service discovery. It significantly simplifies writing reliable distributed applications.
features:
- description: Wraps the raw ZooKeeper client with connection management, retry policies, and error handling for reliable distributed coordination.
  name: High-Level ZooKeeper Client
- description: Provides a chainable, readable Java DSL for all ZooKeeper CRUD operations including watchers, transactions, and ACLs.
  name: Fluent Builder API
- description: 'Pre-built implementations of distributed patterns: leader election, locks, semaphores, barriers, counters, queues, and group membership.'
  name: Distributed Coordination Recipes
- description: curator-x-discovery provides a ZooKeeper-based service registry and discovery mechanism with instance registration and lookup.
  name: Service Discovery
- description: curator-async provides a CompletionStage-based async API with O/R modeling and schema migration for ZooKeeper data.
  name: Asynchronous DSL
- description: CuratorCache provides an efficient local replica of ZooKeeper subtrees with near-real-time change notifications.
  name: Node Caching
- description: curator-test includes TestingServer (embedded ZooKeeper) and TestingCluster for writing reliable unit and integration tests.
  name: Testing Support
- description: Configurable retry policies (ExponentialBackoff, BoundedExponentialBackoff, RetryNTimes, etc.) for handling transient failures.
  name: Retry Policies
