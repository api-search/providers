description: ASCE Amplify is a platform created by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) that provides civil engineering data and advocacy tools. The platform includes the ASCE Hazard Tool API, which provides a simple interface to query locations in the United States for environmental hazard data by geographic location. The Hazard Tool API covers seismic, wind, snow, ice, flood, and other environmental hazard loads used in structural design per ASCE standards. ASCE Amplify also supports advocacy, connecting civil engineers with elected officials to advocate for infrastructure investment and sustainable practices.
features:
- description: Query any US location by latitude and longitude or address to retrieve site-specific environmental hazard values for structural design, including ASCE 7 seismic, wind, snow, and ice parameters.
  name: Geographic Hazard Lookup
- description: Retrieve seismic design parameters including Ss, S1, SMS, SM1, SDS, SD1, and spectral acceleration values per ASCE 7 for any US location.
  name: ASCE 7 Seismic Parameters
- description: Access design wind speed values for various risk categories and exposure categories per ASCE 7 for structural wind load calculations.
  name: Wind Speed Data
- description: Retrieve ground snow load values and ice storm data for design of roof structures and overhead transmission lines per ASCE 7.
  name: Snow and Ice Load Data
- description: Tools for ASCE members to contact elected officials and advocate for infrastructure funding, engineering standards, and professional issues.

integrations:
- description: API values directly correspond to ASCE 7 Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures, the primary reference standard for US structural engineering.
  name: ASCE 7 Standards
- description: Hazard parameters from the API align with International Building Code requirements that reference ASCE 7 for environmental load design values.
