description: APIs.json is an open, machine-readable specification that API providers can use to describe their API operations, similar to how websites use sitemap.xml. The format provides a lightweight means for individuals and organizations to document the location of their APIs, associated descriptions, human and machine-readable specifications, and ancillary information such as licensing, maintainers, and terms of service. It was created by Kin Lane and Steven Willmott in May 2014 and is maintained as an open IETF-style draft. The current stable version is 0.19, published in November 2024. APIs.json files can be placed at the root of any domain as /apis.json or /apis.yml for automated discovery. The specification defines root-level fields (name, description, url, apis, common), API-level fields (aid, humanURL, baseURL, tags, properties), and a comprehensive list of property types covering documentation, authentication, licensing, support, and governance. It is the foundation for the APIs.io
  search engine and API Commons initiative.
features:
- description: Provides a machine-readable format for documenting API operations beyond just the technical interface, covering documentation, pricing, authentication, terms of service, support, and governance.
  name: Machine-Readable API Operations
- description: APIs.json files can be placed at /apis.json or /apis.yml at the root of any domain, enabling automated discovery by search engines and robots without prior knowledge of the API provider.
  name: Domain Root Discovery
- description: Defines a comprehensive enumerated set of property types (OpenAPI, Documentation, Authentication, Pricing, Support, etc.) enabling consistent machine-readable indexing of API operations.
  name: Property Type System
- description: Supports federated API directories through include references, allowing a root APIs.json to reference other APIs.json files on different servers or domains.
  name: Federation via Include
- description: A single APIs.json file can document multiple APIs in the apis array, with shared properties in the common section, enabling organization-wide API catalogs.
  name: Multiple API Collections
- description: Defines authoritative (same DNS domain) and non-authoritative entries, with conflict resolution rules giving priority to the most specific authoritative entry.
  name: Authority and Non-Authority
- description: Supports overlay specifications that can modify or extend existing APIs.json entries, enabling provider-agnostic enrichment of API metadata.
  name: Overlay Support
- description: Maintained as a versioned specification from 0.11 through current 0.19, with full version history and diff comparisons available on GitHub and apisjson.org.
